  "summary": "1. Modern NLP pipelines start with Named Entity Recognition (NER) and link the identified entities to a knowledge graph for easy retrieval of context.\n  2. Unsupervised keyword extraction methods help identify core themes in documents, ensuring consistency across tags.\n  3. Sentence-level embeddings are used for semantic search, mapping each document paragraph into a 384-dimensional space for quick retrieval.\n  4. The workflow architecture includes a Trend Monitor & Tagger that scrapes news APIs daily for technology headlines and stores the trend embeddings alongside internal doc embeddings for cross-referencing.\n  5. After draft generation, content flows through an editorial review process before being published on the WordPress site via a REST API.",
