  "summary": "1. In this exercise, we'll create a simple commit and inspect the objects stored in our `.git` folder to gain insight into how Git works.\n  2. To do this, create a new folder, initialize it as a git repo, create a file, stage it, and commit it to your new repo.\n  3. Look at your `.git` folder using the command `tree`.\n  4. Inspect the objects in your `.git/objects` folder using `git cat-file`. Find the tree, blob, and commit objects for your recent commit.\n  5. Look at your `.git/HEAD` and `.git/refs/heads/master` files to understand where these references are pointing.",
