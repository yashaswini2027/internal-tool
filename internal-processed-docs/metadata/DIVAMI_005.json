  "summary": "1. The application can navigate to any page within it by changing the URL path.\n   2. A brute-force attack can be performed on the login page using BurpSuite, by entering a dummy password for a registered email, intercepting the login request, sending it to Burp Intruder, adding a payload field, and using a list of common passwords.\n   3. Weak passwords can easily be guessed through brute-force tactics using well-known password lists.\n   4. The application does not implement multi-factor authentication for email, and only checks if the content in the Email entry contains an '@' symbol, but does not validate it as a company email.\n   5. Bypass login authentication can be achieved by intercepting the login request, modifying the payload (removing the password field, replacing it with null, or removing both email and password fields), and forwarding the request.",
