With the advent of compact transformer models (e.g., MiniLM, DistilBERT), even small teams can implement semantic search without a huge infrastructure investment.\r\n\r\nBody:\r\n1. **Entity Recognition & Knowledge Graphs**  \r\n   Modern NLP pipelines start with Named Entity Recognition (NER). For example, spaCy’s `en_core_web_sm` model can identify “Divami Design Labs,” “OpenAI,” and “GPT-4o” as distinct entities. Once extracted, these entities can be linked to a knowledge graph—storing nodes for People, Projects, and Technologies. In our internal workflow, we tag every document with entities like “Project Athena,” “Acorns Financial Services,” and “AI-PR Agent” so that downstream components (e.g., Prompt Generator) can quickly retrieve context.\r\n\r\n2. **Keyword Extraction & Tagging**  \r\n   Beyond entities, unsupervised keyword extraction methods (TF-IDF or YAKE) help identify core themes. For example, in Q2 2025, “semantic search,” “vector embeddings,” and “editorial review” have spiked in our internal documents. By normalizing these keywords into a controlled vocabulary, we ensure consistency across tags so that “Semantic Search” and “semantic-search” don’t split into two separate clusters.\r\n\r\n3. **Vector Embeddings & Semantic Search**  \r\n   Sentence-level embeddings (e.g., using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) map each document paragraph into a 384-dimensional space. In our FAISS index, a simple nearest‐neighbor search can retrieve “Client_Report_001” when someone types “user growth Q1 2025” in our internal dashboard. We also experiment with Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) for multi-lingual support (e.g., Hindi + English).\r\n\r\n4. **Workflow Architecture**  \r\n   Referencing our mermaid diagram:  \r\n\r\nHere, the “Trend Monitor & Tagger” scrapes news APIs (e.g., NewsAPI.org) daily for technology headlines—tagging them with keywords such as “AI Ethics,” “Generative Models,” and “Regulatory Compliance.” These external trend embeddings are then stored alongside internal doc embeddings for cross‐referencing.\r\n\r\n5. **Editorial Review & Publishing**  \r\nOnce a draft is generated (e.g., “Write a blog post about semantic search trends”), the content flows to a React/Next.js editorial dashboard where Gopal Verma and Priya Menon can review. After approval, a webhook pushes the final HTML to our WordPress site via the REST API.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nImplementing an end-to-end NLP powered knowledge management pipeline not only reduces search time by 40% but also ensures that Divami’s teams remain aligned with external market trends.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n"
